# 🖼️ Image Forgery Detection using ELA and Deep Learning

## 📌 Introduction

In today's digital era, the widespread use of sophisticated image-editing tools has made it increasingly easy to manipulate images — leading to **image forgeries**, **fake media**, and **misinformation**. Image forgery has become a serious concern, especially in contexts like **fake news**, **legal evidence manipulation**, and **social media deception**.

This project presents a method for **detecting tampered images** using a combination of **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. 

> ELA highlights areas in an image that may have been altered by analyzing differences in compression levels. When an image is edited, certain regions exhibit different error levels compared to the rest of the image. These anomalies can be detected and classified using deep learning models.

## 🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a **robust and automated system** that can:
- Detect forged regions in an image using ELA.
- Classify images as **authentic** or **tampered** using a trained **CNN model**.
- Provide visual evidence of possible image manipulation.

## 📷 Technologies & Techniques Used

- **🔍 Error Level Analysis (ELA)** for preprocessing.
- **🤖 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for classification.
- **📚 TensorFlow / Keras** for model development.
- **🧪 Scikit-learn, OpenCV, PIL** for data processing and image transformation.
- **🧠 Supervised Learning** using labeled datasets (Authentic vs Tampered).
- **📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization.

2. **ELA Transformation →**
3. **CNN Feature Extraction & Classification →**
4. **Output: Authentic / Tampered**

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of:
- **Authentic Images** (unmodified, pristine images)
- **Tampered Images** (edited or manipulated images)

Each image is processed through **ELA**, generating a new representation that highlights possible forgery zones. These representations are then fed into a CNN model for classification.


📌 **Future Enhancements**
Add Grad-CAM visualization for forged region localization.
Explore Transformer-based models (ViT) for improved accuracy.
Deploy as a Flask-based web application.
Extend to video forgery detection.
